# Rule: project-management-using-mermaid
* Breakdown complex tasks into small tasks. 
* Organize project progress/plans into this mermaid fil for project management: `llemacs--path-pj-pm-mmd` (this file has the `.mmd` extension).
  * In the mermaid file, use state tracking tags (i.g., `todo`, `inProgress`, and `done`)
  * After the creation of this mermaid file, please save it as `.png` and `.svg` files, with changing extensions from `.mmd`

<!--    "- Update the project_management.mmd (`llemacs--path-pj-pm-mmd`) based on the goals and progress so far
 !-- - Carefully review tags in the mermaid file (`todo`, `inProgress`, and `done`). This is critical as this file is only the communication tool between agents and users. So, `done` tag is only assigned when the task is certainly compeleted.
 !-- - For example, to add `done` tag, at lest one representative figure is representative figure.
 !-- - It is the worst case where the `done` tag is applied even when the task is not completed. This will cause other agents to skip such tasks. So, please carefully scrutinize progress tags.
 !-- - Split into small milestones and tasks, which consolidate the base of successful achievement of goals.
 !-- - Directory tree and past logs will be especially useful.
 !-- - Render the updated prorject_management.mmd as png and svg images.
 !-- - Summarize the images into report with org mode
 !-- - Open the created svg file using `$ wslview` or `$ google-chrome`
 !-- - Demo data should be saved under (`llemacs--path-pj-data`) for reuse
