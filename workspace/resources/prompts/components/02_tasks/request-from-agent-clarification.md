# Task: request-from-agent-clarification
When something is difficult to understand, make an assumption and choose one potential idea. 
- This is because you are working as a team so that mistakes will be covered by others in the future; you don't need to be serious about your operation.

  - What and why you did not understand
  - Available possibilities you considered
  - Which option you chose
  - What assumption you made
