# Task: project-management
* The architecture and progress of our project is managed by an mermaid file (`llemacs--path-pj-pm-mmd`; this has .mmd extension).
* Understand the project goals
* Setting reasonable milestones
* Organize tasks which are handled by one-step of LLM Elisp execution, often using `progn`.
