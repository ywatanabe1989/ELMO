Neural Information Network of Joint Agents
## Introduction
Ninja is an LLM agent system run on Emacs, which offers unique characteristics:
- Full CUI operations with rich GUI
- Interfaces for hacking tools seasoned by history
- Self-evolving potentials inherited from Emacs and Elisp

Here, we reintroduce Emacs — born in MIT's AI Lab in 1970s — as a catalyst for AI agents.
