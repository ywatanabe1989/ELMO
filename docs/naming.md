# Semacs: self-evolving agent on Emacs

# Semacs: self-evolving agent on Emacs
# SEA: self-evolving agent on Emacs

## Introduction
The integration of Emacs and LLM agents offers unique advantages:

- Purely text-based operations, which are highly compatible with LLMs
- Emacs ecosystem with extensive customization
- Natural interaction with Emacs users
- Central hub for development tools and system operations

Here, we revive Emacs - born in MIT's AI Lab in the 1970s - as a modern platform for AI agents.
