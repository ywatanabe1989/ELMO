# Llemacs â€” LLM Agents on Emacs
<img src="./docs/logo/llemacs.gif" width="100" alt="Llemacs Logo">
Llemacs is a file-based LLM agent system implemented in Elisp

## Features
- [x] Multiple LLM provider support (Anthropic/Google/DeepSeek)
- [x] Structured logging with SQLite and file-based systems
- [x] Template-based prompt management
- [x] Mermaid-based project visualization
- [x] Containerized execution via Apptainer
- [ ] Version control integration
- [ ] Capture user corrections
- [ ] Learning Mechanism
  - Store successful patterns
  - PR feedback as metrics

## Disclaimer
- This repository is under active development
- The system is not yet fully functional yet
- Although Apptainer restricts agent access to the [`./workspace`](./workspace) directory, we assume no responsibility for any unintended file modifications.

## Automatic project development

``` elisp
(llemacs-llm-switch-provider "google")

(progn
  ;; Initialize a project: setting project-name and goals
  (llemacs--pj-init 
      "epilepsy-prediction-project" 
      "- Create demo ECoG signals sampled at 400 Hz with 16 channels
       - Create a demo script to classify preictal vs. interictal states using machine learning
       - Evaluate the performances using balanced accuracy, with plotting confusion matrix")
       
  ;; On WSL: Symlink to file:///C:/Users/wyusu/Documents/current-project-win
  (llemacs--path-pj-update-symlink) 

  ;; Single thread version for debugging: (llemacs-run--steps 7)
  (llemacs-run-steps 7)
  
  ;; Monitoring automatic development
  (llemacs-monitor)
)
```

## Installation

Generated by mermaid ([source](./docs/project_flow/project_flow.mmd)), which will be helpful for both users and agents.

## Permission control via Apptainer

Apptainer provides permission control by restricting agent access to the workspace directory only.

``` bash
main -m build  # Create sandbox
main -m shell  # Enter sandbox
main -m run    # Launch Emacs as an agent
```
